1.**Database setup**

  - Database creation : Create a database in the SSMS as P1.
  - Table creation : A table named Retail_dat is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE P1;

    CREATE TABLE Retail_dat
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
